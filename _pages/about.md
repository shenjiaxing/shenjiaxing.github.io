I am currently an Assistant Professor with [Division of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ln.edu.hk/sds/dai), School of Data Science, Lingnan University. 
I hold a B.E. degree in Software Engineering from Jilin University and a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (supervised by [Prof. Jiannong Cao](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/)).
I was a visiting scholar at MIT Media Lab (hosted by [Prof. Alex 'Sandy' Pentland](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/sandy/overview/)).
<!-- I hold a B.E. degree from Jilin University (2014) and a Ph.D. degree from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (2019), with additional research experience gained during a visiting scholarship at MIT Media Lab in 2017. -->

My research centers on AIoT-empowered Human Dynamics, a field that strives to decode human behavior and deliver practical insights by weaving together cross-disciplinary knowledge with AI and IoT. Within this domain, my research interests include Context-aware Computing, Mobile Computing, Data Mining, and Generative AI.

I have contributed over <span id='num_total'>NA</span> publications to esteemed journals including ACM TOIS, ACM IMWUT, IEEE TMC, IEEE TKDE, IEEE TPDS, and JSAC as well as prestigious conferences such as WWW, IEEE INFOCOM, and IEEE ICDM.
I am honored to have received two best paper awards, one of which was presented at IEEE INFOCOM 2020, a leading conference in networking and communications.
