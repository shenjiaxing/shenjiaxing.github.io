<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an Assistant Professor at The Department of Computing and Decision Sciences, Lingnan University. Previously, I was with the Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University as a Research Assistant Professor from 2020 to 2022. 
I obtained B.E. in Software Engineering and Ph.D. in Computer Science from <a href="https://global.jlu.edu.cn/">Jilin University</a> in 2014 and <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/">The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</a> in 2019, respectively. I was also a visiting scholar at Media Lab, <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> in 2017.

My central research theme is Human Dynamics which refers to interdisciplinary research studying human behavior and providing actionable insights. 
Under the theme, I have several research interests including Context Sensing, IoT Systems, Mobile Computing, and Data Mining. 
I have published over 25 papers in top-tier journals and conferences including TMC, TKDE, TOIS, IoT-J, INFOCOM, WWW, ICDM, and ICDCS. 
I have also won Best Paper Award twice including one from INFOCOM 2020.
