I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computing and Decision Sciences, Lingnan University. Previously, I was with the Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University as a Research Assistant Professor from 2020 to 2022. 
I obtained B.E. in Software Engineering and Ph.D. in Computer Science from Jilin University in 2014 and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2019, respectively. I was also a visiting scholar at Media Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2017. 

My central research theme is Human Dynamics which refers to interdisciplinary research studying human behavior and providing actionable insights. 
Under the theme, I have several research interests including Context Sensing, IoT Systems, Mobile Computing, and Data Mining. 
I have published over 25 papers in top-tier journals and conferences including TMC, TKDE, TOIS, IoT-J, INFOCOM, WWW, ICDM, and ICDCS. 
I have also won Best Paper Award twice including one from INFOCOM 2020. 

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total
