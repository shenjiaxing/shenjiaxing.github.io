<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an Assistant Professor with the Department of Computing and Decision Sciences at <a href="https://www.ln.edu.hk/">Lingnan University</a>. Previously, I was with the Department of Computing at <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/">the Hong Kong Polytechnic University</a> as a Research Assistant Professor from 2020 to 2022. 
I obtained the B.E. degree in Software Engineering from <a href="https://global.jlu.edu.cn/">Jilin University</a> in 2014, and the Ph.D. degree in Computing from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2019. 
In 2017, I was a visiting scholar with the Media Lab at <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>.

The theme of my research is [**Human Dynamics**](#data-driven-analytics-of-human-dynamics) which aims to understand human behavior and provide actionable insights via cross-disciplinary approaches.
Under the theme, my research interests include **Context Sensing**, **IoT Systems**, **Mobile Computing**, and **Data Mining**. 
I have published over <span id='num_total'>NA</span> papers including top-tier journals and conferences such as IEEE TMC, IEEE TKDE, ACM TOIS, ACM IMWUT, IEEE INFOCOM, and WWW (including <span id='num_ccfa' onload='countPapers()'>NA</span> <span class="ccfa_inline">CCF-A</span> and <span id='num_ccfb'>NA</span> <span class="ccfb_inline">CCF-B</span>).
<!-- and <span id='num_jcr1'>NA</span> <span class="jcrq1_inline">JCR-Q1</span>) -->
I have also won two <span class="best_paper_inline">Best Paper</span> awards including one from <a href="#wang_push_2020" class="inpageurl">IEEE INFOCOM 2020</a>.

# Data-Driven Analytics of Human Dynamics
Below shows a pyramid of Human Dynamics research.
It covers both my previous research effort and future directions.

        <p>Social level refers to interplay between individuals including <a href="#shenbag_c">social tie</a>, social influence, and social recommendation. Although social level is also difficult to capture and quantify, it is still feasible by combining physical and psychological cues.</p>

        <p>Physical level refers to human dynamics that can be directly observed.
