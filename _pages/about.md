<!-- <span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span> -->
I am Assistant Professor at Lingnan University. 
I hold a B.E. degree from Jilin University (2014) and a Ph.D. degree from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (2019), with additional research experience gained during a visiting scholarship at MIT Media Lab in 2017.

My research centers on AIoT-empowered Human Dynamics, a field that strives to decode human behavior and deliver practical insights by weaving together cross-disciplinary knowledge with AI and IoT. Within this domain, my research interests span Context-aware Computing, Mobile Computing, Data Mining, and Generative AI.

I have contributed over <span id='num_total'>NA</span> publications to esteemed journals including ACM TOIS, ACM IMWUT, IEEE TMC, IEEE TKDE, and IEEE TPDS as well as prestigious conferences such as WWW, IEEE INFOCOM, and IEEE ICDM.
I am honored to have received two best paper awards, one of which was presented at IEEE INFOCOM 2020, a leading conference in networking and communications.
