I am currently an Assistant Professor with [Division of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ln.edu.hk/sds/dai), School of Data Science, Lingnan University. 
I hold a BE degree in Software Engineering from Jilin University and a PhD degree in Computer Science from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
I was a visiting scholar at MIT Media Lab.

My research centers on AIoT-empowered Human Dynamics, a field that strives to decode human behavior and deliver practical insights by weaving together cross-disciplinary knowledge with AI and IoT. Within this domain, my research interests include Human-centric Computing, Context-aware Computing, Mobile Computing, Data Mining, and Generative AI.

With over <span id='num_total'>NA</span> publications in top-tier journals (e.g., ACM TOIS, IEEE TMC, IEEE TKDE) and conferences (e.g., WWW, IEEE INFOCOM), I have established myself as a thought leader in applying cutting-edge AI techniques to solve complex challenges. My contributions have been recognized with two Best Paper Awards, including one at IEEE INFOCOM 2020, a premier venue for networking and communication research.

Dr. Shen is passionate about bridging academia and industry by leveraging AI innovations to drive practical solutions. He actively seeks collaborations with industry partners to develop AI-powered systems that address pressing societal and business needs. His current projects include exploring Personalized Large Language Models (LLMs) for tailored applications in customer engagement, education, and beyond.

By combining interdisciplinary expertise with a focus on impactful AI applications, Dr. Shen’s work is poised to attract industrial funding aimed at fostering innovation and delivering measurable value across diverse domains.

This version highlights Dr. Shen’s alignment with industry-relevant AI applications while maintaining his academic credentials to appeal to potential industrial sponsors.

<!-- I have contributed over <span id='num_total'>NA</span> publications to esteemed journals including ACM TOIS, ACM IMWUT, IEEE TMC, IEEE TKDE, IEEE TPDS, and JSAC as well as prestigious conferences such as WWW, IEEE INFOCOM, and IEEE ICDM.
I am honored to have received two best paper awards, one of which was presented at IEEE INFOCOM 2020, a leading conference in networking and communications.
