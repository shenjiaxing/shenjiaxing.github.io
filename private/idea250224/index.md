# Adaptive Tour Guide Agent for Theme Parks: Intelligent Itinerary Management Through Multi-Scale Mobility Forecasting  

## Core Research Problem: Dynamic Itinerary Planning Under Uncertainty  
The critical challenge lies in creating an **autonomous decision-making agent** that continuously optimizes visitor experiences through:  
1. **Multi-Timescale Forecasting**  
   - Long-term (daily): Seasonal patterns and ticket sales  
   - Mid-term (hourly): Weather impacts and group arrivals via public transit APIs  
   - Short-term (15-30min): Attraction wait time projections  
   - Real-time: Pedestrian flow tracking through WiFi/CCTV analytics  

2. **Context-Aware Replanning**  
   Balancing four dynamic factors:  
   1. Visitor preferences (adaptive interest profiles)  
   2. Mobility constraints (pathway congestion)  
   3. Operational status (ride availability)  
   4. External influences (public transit schedules)  

## Technical Innovation: Hierarchical Prediction-Planning Architecture  

### 1. Multi-Source Mobility Forecasting Engine  
| Time Horizon | Data Sources | Prediction Model | Use Case |  
|-------------|--------------|------------------|----------|  
| 6-24hr | Park admission records, weather APIs | GNN with Graph Attention | Daily staffing/resource allocation |  
| 1-4hr | Public transit APIs, hotel checkouts | Transformer Temporal Fusion | Anticipating visitor influx peaks |  
| 15-60min | IoT sensors, queue cameras | LSTM-Conv Hybrid | Wait time projections |  
| 0-15min | WiFi/CV-based tracking | Kalman Filter Ensemble | Real-time congestion avoidance |  

### 2. Agent Decision-Making Framework  
**Planning Core**: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm enhanced with:  
- **Reward Function**: Combines preference satisfaction, experience quality (wait/ride ratio), and movement efficiency  
- **Dynamic Replanning**: Triggered by:  
  - Wait time deviations >15% from forecasts  
  - Pathway congestion exceeding capacity thresholds  
  - User behavior changes (dwell time anomalies)  

**Generative AI Integration**:  
- LLM-based explanation system ("Changed recommendation because Fantasyland crowds increased 40% in last 20min")  
- AR visualization of alternative routes using HERE Technologies' mobility data  

## Implementation Roadmap  

### Phase 1: Agent Development  
1. **Data Fusion Layer**: Integrate park operations (Oracle OPERA), mobility (HERE API), and visitor data  
2. **Simulation Environment**: Unity-based digital twin calibrated with Ocean Park's 2023 visitation patterns  

### Phase 2: Field Testing  
- A/B test against existing systems (TourVista)  
- Key metrics: Plan adherence rate, replanning frequency, preference-deviance score
