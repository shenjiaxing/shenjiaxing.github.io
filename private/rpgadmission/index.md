# PhD Opportunities in Spatiotemporal Data Mining & Personalized LLMs

I welcome motivated PhD applicants interested in advancing research at the intersection of:

- **Spatiotemporal Data Mining**  
  Developing novel deep learning architectures for urban computing, traffic prediction, and geospatial AI applications.

- **Personalized Large Language Models**  
  Creating adaptive LLM frameworks with persoanlity awareness for domain-specific applications.

## Admission Requirements

Prospective candidates should possess:

- Recognized Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science, Data Science, Geoinformatics, or related fields
- Demonstrated research experience through academic publications or technical projects
- Strong problem-solving skills in machine learning/deep learning
- Proficiency in English (TOEFL/IELTS for non-native speakers)
- Programming expertise in Python/PyTorch and experience with spatial databases (PostGIS) is preferred

## Research Environment

Successful applicants will:  
- Work with real-world spatiotemporal datasets (urban mobility, IoT sensor networks)
- Develop novel neural architectures for time-series and graph-structured data
- Explore LLM personalization techniques using spatial-temporal context
- Publish at top-tier venues (KDD, ICDM, AAAI, IJCAI)

## Application Materials

Interested candidates should email:
1. CV (highlighting relevant coursework/research)  
2. Transcripts (BSc/MSc)  
3. Publication samples (if available)  
4. 1-page research statement outlining your interests  

I particularly encourage applicants with experience in:  
- Spatial-temporal modeling  
- LLM fine-tuning techniques
- Graph neural networks  
- Transformer architectures
